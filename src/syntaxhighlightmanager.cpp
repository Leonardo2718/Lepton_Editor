Description:
    Lepton Editor is a text editor oriented towards programmers.  It's intended to be a
    flexible and extensible code editor which developers can easily customize to their
    liking.

    This file contains the implementation for the SyntaxHighlightManager class.  It is used
    to manage the syntax highlighting files as well as to provide a menu for selecting
    or changing the language used for highlighting.  This class is intended to provide
    an interface for managing the language lexers used in the ScintillaEditor class.
